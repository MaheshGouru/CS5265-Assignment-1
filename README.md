# CS5265-Assignment-1
Week 1 Assignment: Machine Learning Environment

### Comment 2 from Jeff
The proposed project seems well-formed and thought-out, with sufficiently technical detail and data descriptions.

~~Week 1 Assignment: Machine Learning Environment~~

Week 2 Assignment: Git and Github Environment

## Description of Metrics
Note: Recommended to use all values presented in a confusion matrix 
as covered in class to assess the business value of the project.
Performing some market or business research on the domain would help 
obtain an estimate of the costs/spending/revenue as needed.

To evaluate the performance, the use of 3 parameterized benchmarks in OpenCL:
stereo, convolution and raycasting would illustrate the portability of 
demonstrating the time to train ANN models. In addition, the accuracy can also
be evaluated by comparing the predictions against replicated execution times
for verified parameter configurations.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) hosts the NVIDIA V100 GPU with 16GB GPU RAM and 900GB/s bandwidth 
and the Tesla K80 12GB VRAM, 240GBps bandwidth at $2.48 and $0.45 per hour, 
respectively as cited by [Comparison of Cloud GPU Providers](https://thechief.io/c/editorial/comparison-cloud-gpu-providers/).
Further exploration regarding the efficacy could be provide insight for which vendors
may be better suited for hosting a specific methodology reducing overhead costs for training neural networks.
This could provide a dynamic stratification of where to train based on web-scraped costs.
