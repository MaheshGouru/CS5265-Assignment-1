        "The data set measures the running time of a matrix-matrix product A*B = C, where all matrices have size 2048 x 2048, using a parameterizable SGEMM GPU kernel with 241600 possible parameter combinations. For each tested combination, 4 runs were performed and their results are reported as the 4 last columns. All times are measured in milliseconds*.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 14 parameter, the first 10 are ordinal and can only take up to 4 different powers of two values, and the 4 last variables are binary. Out of 1327104 total parameter combinations, only 241600 are feasible (due to various kernel constraints). This data set contains the results for all these feasible combinations.\n",
